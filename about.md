Welcome to my personal projects and thoughts - I hope you enjoy reading through them!

I focus on machine learning, statistics, data analysis, data visualization, and so on.  E.g. data science.  Python is my preferred language, but I also do a few things in R and sometimes play around in Julia.

I'm an Austin native, I spend a lot of time with my wife and dogs, and I like solving problems with data.
