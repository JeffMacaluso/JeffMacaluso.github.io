Welcome to my GitHub page! This is a place for showcasing my personal projects, the code I use for competitions, and so on. I'll have more in my regular GitHub, so check that out if you want to see other projects that aren't fully complete. I believe in sharing information with others, so feel free to reach out with any questions or comments.

I focus on machine learning, statistics, data analysis, data visualization, and so on. E.g. data science. Python is my preferred language, but I also do a few things in R and sometimes play around in Julia.

I'm an Austin native, I spend a lot of time with my wife and dogs, and I like solving problems with data. I also enjoy hiking, reading, traveling, and playing board games with friends.
